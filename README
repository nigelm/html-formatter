NAME
    HTML::Formatter - Base class for HTML formatters

VERSION
    version 2.10

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::FormatSomething;
      my $infile  = "whatever.html";
      my $outfile = "whatever.file";
      open OUT, ">$outfile"
       or die "Can't write-open $outfile: $!\n";

      print OUT HTML::FormatSomething->format_file(
        $infile,
          'option1' => 'value1',
          'option2' => 'value2',
          ...
      );
      close(OUT);

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::Formatter is a base class for classes that take HTML and format it
    to some output format. When you take an object of such a base class and
    call "$formatter->format( $tree )" with an HTML::TreeBuilder (or
    HTML::Element) object, they return the

    HTML formatters are able to format a HTML syntax tree into various
    printable formats. Different formatters produce output for different
    output media. Common for all formatters are that they will return the
    formatted output when the format() method is called. The format() method
    takes a HTML::Element object (usually the HTML::TreeBuilder root object)
    as parameter.

METHODS
  new
        my $formatter = FormatterClass->new(
            option1 => value1, option2 => value2, ...
        );

    This creates a new formatter object with the given options.

  format_file
  format_from_file
        $string = FormatterClass->format_file(
            $html_source,
            option1 => value1, option2 => value2, ...
            );

    Return a string consisting of the result of using the given class to
    format the given HTML file according to the given (optional) options.
    Internally it calls "SomeClass->new( ... )->format( ... )" on a new
    HTML::TreeBuilder object based on the given HTML file.

  format_string
  format_from_string
        $string = FormatterClass->format_string(
            $html_source,
            option1 => value1, option2 => value2, ...
            );

    Return a string consisting of the result of using the given class to
    format the given HTML source according to the given (optional) options.
    Internally it calls "SomeClass->new( ... )->format( ... )" on a new
    HTML::TreeBuilder object based on the given source.

  format
        my $render_string = $formatter->format( $html_tree_object );

    This renders the given HTML object according to the options set for
    $formatter.

    After you've used a particular formatter object to format a particular
    HTML tree object, you probably should not use either again.
